# Haskell Calculator Project

This project is known as an final project of *CS1XA3* course

# Brief Introduction

The codes are basically base on these samples which made by our instructor, links are down here
  - [ExprType.hs](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~dalvescb/Code/ExprType.hs)
  - [ExprParser.hs](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~dalvescb/Code/ExprParser.hs)
  - [ExprDiff.hs](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~dalvescb/Code/ExprDiff.hs)
  - [ExprPretty.hs](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~dalvescb/Code/ExprPretty.hs)
  - [ExprTest.hs](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~dalvescb/Code/ExprTest.hs)


After that, I added *sin, cos, log, exp expresssion*, as well as did some changes to other four files to make it work properly. Details and comments are inside the codes and the documentation.
